# SoftwareDictionary
Source data for thequalityduck.co.uk software terms dictionary.

This is currently a work in progress and the dictionary is not live. The idea is to provide a collaborative, community driven resource that provides simple definitions of common terms and acronyms used within software development. Once live the link will be available in this readme.
